Anyscan Explorer for any EVM chain

## Motivation 

Building an alternative and cheaper version of Etherscan for EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) chains can have several motivations:

* Cost Savings: The cost of using Etherscan can be high for some users, particularly those conducting many transactions. An alternative that is less expensive can appeal to these users.
* User Experience: Some users may find the user experience of Etherscan lacking in certain areas, and building an alternative with improved UX can attract these users.
* Customization: Some users may require customized features that Etherscan doesn't provide. An alternative that offers these customization options can attract these users.
* Decentralization: Etherscan is a centralized platform, which can create single points of failure and be subject to censorship. Building a decentralized alternative can appeal to users who value the decentralization and censorship resistance of blockchain technology.

## Implementation 

Anyscan uses ReactJS, NodeJS and MongoDB. 

List of benefits: 

* React: React is a popular and widely-used JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a fast and efficient way to build complex, dynamic, and interactive interfaces with a high level of user engagement.
* MongoDB: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that is well-suited for storing large amounts of semi-structured data, such as blockchain transactions. It provides fast and flexible querying capabilities, allowing for quick and efficient retrieval of data.
* Scalability: Both React and MongoDB are highly scalable, which is important for an application like an Etherscan alternative that may be handling a large volume of data.
* Community Support: Both React and MongoDB have large and active communities, which can provide resources, tools, and support for building and maintaining the application.
* Integration: React and MongoDB can easily be integrated with other technologies, such as blockchain networks and payment systems, to provide a comprehensive solution for managing and tracking blockchain transactions.
* Overall, building an Etherscan alternative on React and MongoDB provides advantages such as scalability, community support, fast and efficient querying capabilities, and easy integration with other technologies.
